# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project OVerview

I was asked to analyze the employment database of the Pewlett-Hackard to find the quantity of retiring employees by thier position/titles. 

### The 2 main objective:
1. Prepare for the incoming waves of retirements and 
2. Create a mentorship program to train the next generation of employees. 

## Resources
  * PostgreSQL 13.2
  * pgAdmin 4.50
  
Provided Data files:
  * departments.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, titles.csv
 
 # Analysis Results
 
 Data information : Employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 grouped by title/posistions. 
 
  * A total of 90,398 employees are retiring or nearing retirement.
  * The most effected positions by the incoming wave of retirement will be titles associated as Senior Engineers and Senior Staff.
  * 2 managers are retiring which reduces the management team to 7 from their current 9 managers

## Mentorship Program
 
 1,549 current employees born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965 are eligible.
 
# Summary & Recommendation

After analyzing the copmany employment records:
 * 1,549 current employees would qualify for becoming mentors
 * 11% of mentors have the title "Senior Engineer"
 * 32.5% of retirees are Senior Engineers

# WARNING: Zero of the mentors have the title "Manager", which is a critical position that needs to be filled after the current managers retire and there are not enough new employees to be trained.
 
Additionally as the retirement numbers begin to impact Pawlett-Hackard, there will be 90,398 roles vacant across all departments that will need to be filled.
 * 2 of which are high level management positions

My recommendation is to stream line a company mentorship program and an intership program to help fill in need employment vacancies, with a policy to have the retirement ready employees train the new hires in business procedures. Which in turn, will promote PH as a greate employeer and at the same time train talented employees ready for the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard business objectives. Recommended to widely expand hiring efforts across departments. Also, it is recommended to expand the pool of qualifed mentors by widening the birth year parameter. By increasing the number of both mentors and new employees, it will be possible to prepare for the incoming wave of retirements and allow the company to focus efforts on increasing sales and brand influence.
